## Challenges

### 1. **[Encode and Decode Strings](string-encode-and-decode.py)**
- **Goal**: Encode an array of strings into a single string, then decode it back into the original array.
- **Approach**: For each string, store its length followed by `#`, then the string.
- **Time Complexity**: O(m) where m is the total length of all strings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) auxiliary (excluding the final output).

### 2. **[Valid Sudoku](valid-sudoku.py)**
- **Goal**: Validate a 9x9 Sudoku board by checking that:
  - Each row contains unique digits.
  - Each column contains unique digits.
  - Each 3x3 subgrid contains unique digits.
- **Approach**:
  - Use three dictionaries (`defaultdict(set)`) to track seen numbers in rows, columns, and subgrids.
  - If a duplicate is found in any row, column, or subgrid, return `False`.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (fixed size of 81 cells for a 9x9 board).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space (ignoring input size).

### 3. **[Longest Consecutive Sequence](longest-consecutive-sequence.py)**
- **Goal**: Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence of integers in an array.
- **Approach**:
  - Use a `set` to store the unique integers in the array for fast lookup.
  - For each number, check if it is the start of a sequence (`num - 1` not in the set).
  - If it is, extend the sequence by checking for consecutive numbers (`num + 1`, `num + 2`, etc.) in the set.
  - Keep track of the longest sequence found.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the `set` storing the unique numbers.

### 4. **[Contains Duplicate](contains-duplicate.py)**
- **Goal**: Determine if any value appears more than once in an array.
- **Approach**:
  - Use a dictionary (`memory`) to keep track of numbers encountered so far.
  - Iterate through the array and check if a number is already in the dictionary:
    - If it is, return `True` (duplicate found).
    - Otherwise, add the number to the dictionary.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the dictionary storing encountered numbers.

### 5. **[Valid Anagram](valid-anagram.py)**
- **Goal**: Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other. Two strings are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequencies.
- **Approach**:
  - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are different. If they are, return `False` immediately.
  - Create two dictionaries (`mem_s` and `mem_t`) to store the frequency of each character in the strings `s` and `t`.
  - Iterate through each character in `s` and `t`, updating the dictionaries to count the occurrences of each character.
  - Compare the two dictionaries:
    - If they are equal, the strings are anagrams.
    - Otherwise, they are not.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the longer string (`s` or `t`).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique characters in the strings.

### 6. **[Two Sum](two-sum.py)**
- **Goal**: Find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in an array `nums` such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] = target\) and \(i \neq j\).
- **Approach**:
  - Use a dictionary (`memory`) to store numbers and their indices as you iterate through the array.
  - For each number, calculate its complement (`target - num`) and check if it exists in the dictionary:
    - If it does, return the indices of the complement and the current number.
    - Otherwise, store the current number and its index in the dictionary.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the dictionary storing encountered numbers.

### 7. **[Valid Palindrome](valid-palindrome.py)**
- **Goal**: Determine if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
- **Approach**:
  - Filter out all non-alphanumeric characters from the string and convert it to lowercase.
  - Use two pointers (`i` and `j`) to compare characters from the beginning and the end of the string:
    - If any pair of characters does not match, return `False`.
    - If all characters match, the string is a palindrome.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the filtered and converted string.

### 8. **[Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](two-sum-ii.py)**
- **Goal**: Find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) (1-indexed) in a sorted array `numbers` such that \(numbers[i] + numbers[j] = target\) and \(i < j\).
- **Approach**:
  - Use two pointers:
    - One pointer starts at the beginning of the array (`l`).
    - The other starts at the end of the array (`r`).
  - Calculate the sum of the numbers pointed to by `l` and `r`:
    - If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer (`r`) to the left.
    - If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer (`l`) to the right.
    - If the sum equals the target, return the indices adjusted to 1-indexed.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no additional data structures are used.

### 9. **[3Sum](three-sum.py)**
- **Goal**: Find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to `0`. Each triplet should be returned only once, even if there are duplicates in the array.
- **Approach**:
  - Sort the array to simplify handling duplicates and use the two-pointer technique.
  - Iterate through the array, fixing one number at a time, and use two pointers to find pairs that sum to the opposite of the fixed number.
  - Skip duplicates for both the fixed number and the two pointers to avoid duplicate triplets.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no additional data structures are used (excluding the result list).

### 10. **[Container With Most Water](container-with-most-water.py)**
- **Goal**: Given an array `heights` where `heights[i]` represents the height of the \(i^{th}\) bar, find two bars that form a container that can store the maximum amount of water.
- **Approach**:
  - Use the two-pointer technique:
    - Start with one pointer at the beginning (`l`) and one at the end (`r`) of the array.
    - Calculate the area of water the container can hold using the formula:
    
    - Area = min(heights[l], heights[r]) * distance (r - l)
    
    - Move the pointer pointing to the smaller height inward to try and find a taller bar.

    - Keep track of the maximum area encountered during the process.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no additional data structures are used.

### 11. **[Trapping Rain Water](trapping-rain-water.py)**
- **Goal**: Given an array `height` where `height[i]` represents the elevation at index \(i\), calculate how much water can be trapped after raining.
- **Approach**:
  - Use the two-pointer technique to calculate trapped water:
    - Initialize two pointers (`l` and `r`) at the beginning and end of the array.
    - Maintain variables `max_left` and `max_right` to store the maximum height seen so far from the left and right.
    - Move the pointer pointing to the smaller height inward, and calculate the trapped water based on the difference between the current height and the maximum height on that side.
    - Add the trapped water for each step.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no additional data structures are used.

### 12. **[Valid Parentheses](valid-parentheses.py)**
- **Goal**: Determine if a given string `s` consisting of the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]` is valid.
  - A string is valid if:
    1. Every open bracket is closed by the same type of bracket.
    2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
    3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
- **Approach**:
  - Use a **stack** to track unmatched open brackets:
    - When encountering an open bracket, push it onto the stack.
    - When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the last open bracket in the stack:
      - If it matches, pop the stack.
      - If it doesnâ€™t match or the stack is empty, return `False`.
    - At the end, the stack should be empty if all brackets are valid.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the stack used to store unmatched brackets.

### 13. **[Min Stack](min-stack.py)**
- **Goal**: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
- **Approach**:
  - Use two stacks:
    1. **`stack`**: Stores all the elements.
    2. **`min_stack`**: Tracks the minimum value at each point in time.
  - For every `push` operation, calculate the new minimum and add it to `min_stack`.
  - For every `pop` operation, remove the top element from both `stack` and `min_stack`.
  - The minimum element can always be retrieved from the top of `min_stack`.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for all operations (`push`, `pop`, `top`, `getMin`).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the stack.

### 14. **[Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](evaluate-reverse-polish-notation.py)**
- **Goal**: Evaluate an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). The input is a list of tokens representing numbers and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- **Approach**:
  - Use a stack to store numbers and intermediate results:
    - Push numbers onto the stack.
    - When encountering an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
  - Division truncates toward zero.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of tokens.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the stack.

### 15. **[Generate Parentheses](generate-parentheses.py)**
- **Goal**: Generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses given an integer `n`, representing the number of pairs of parentheses.
- **Approach**:
  - Use **backtracking** to explore all possible combinations of parentheses:
    - Add a `(` if the number of open parentheses is less than `n`.
    - Add a `)` if the number of close parentheses is less than the number of open parentheses.
    - Stop when both open and close parentheses are equal to `n`, and add the current combination to the result.
  - Use a `stack` to build each combination step by step and backtrack by removing the last added element (`stack.pop()`).
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(4^n / \sqrt{n})\), due to the Catalan number property.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the recursion stack and temporary `stack`.

### 16. **[Daily Temperatures](daily-temperatures.py)**
- **Goal**: Given a list of daily temperatures, determine how many days you need to wait for a warmer temperature. If no future day has a warmer temperature, the result for that day should be `0`.
- **Approach**:
  - Use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to keep track of temperatures and their indices.
  - For each temperature:
    - Compare it with the last temperature in the stack.
    - If it is warmer, pop the stack and calculate the difference in indices to update the result.
    - Push the current temperature and its index onto the stack.
  - If the stack is not empty after processing all temperatures, the remaining indices correspond to days with no warmer temperature.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array. Each temperature is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the stack and result array.
